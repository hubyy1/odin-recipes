<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A cheesy casserole with all of your favorite pizza toppings. 
<p>I like to serve this with a salad and garlic bread. The leftovers are great. 
I have prepared this in advance and then taken it to potlucks in a slow cooker the next day.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package uncooked egg noodles</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package uncooked egg noodles </li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
    <li>1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
    <li>1 (2.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced pepperoni, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>20 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol><li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Cook the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink, 
        breaking the meat apart into crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes.</li>
    </li>
<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the egg 
    noodles in the boiling water until cooked through yet slightly firm, about 5 minutes; drain.</li>
<li>Mix the noodles with the cooked ground beef, spaghetti sauce, black olives, mushrooms, pepperoni,
     and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese in a large mixing bowl. Spoon the mixture into a 
     9x13-inch baking dish and top with remaining cheese. Cover the dish with foil.</li>
     <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
</ol>
